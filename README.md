Answers:
Day 1:
* What are the neccesary (needed) tags for a working HTML file? - doctype, html, head, title, body
* What is a `<div>` tag is and what it is for? - it is used to dividing sections of the document into more manageable parts

Day 2:
* How do you create a proper form (what tags are needed)? - all form elements should be inside a `form` tag and you must have a submit button; each input element should have a name attribute that acts as a 'handler' for the input
* What is the difference between an ‘id’ and a ‘class’? - you should only have one unique id per html file but you can have multiple classes
* How do you target elements on a web page? - `document.getElementById` or `document.querySelector`

Day 3:
* What is the difference between margin, padding, & border? - padding is the space between the content and the border & margin is the space outside the border
* What is the difference between static, relative, absolute, & fixed? - static is default (meaning no positioning), relative is 'relative to where the element should have been, absolute is relative to it's nearest positioned parent, and fixed is relative to the viewport
* How do transitions work (what do you target)? - you set an action (like hover (i.e. div:hover) and then you add the transition property to the element (i.e. div)

Day 4:
* How do you correctly set up a grid layout? - each column must be in a row & rows can have max 12 columns (nesting is possible)
* How do you target specific elements of Bootstrap components? - check the inspector and see what CSS properties are applied

Day 5:
* How do you make rows & columns within rows & columns?
* What are the basic concepts of GitHub?

Day 6:
* What are the primitive data types? - number, string, and boolean
* What denotes strings? - quotation marks
* What denotes function calls? - the invocation operator `()`

Day 7:
* How do you create an if-else statement?
* What is a predicate? - a statement that evaluates to _either_ true or false

Day 8:
* When do you use while loops? - when you do not know how many times you should loop
* When do you use for loops? - when you know exactly how many times you should loop
* How do you declare a function, pass it arguments, and return values?
* What are higher-order functions? - functions that either take functions as arguments or return functions
* What does it mean when they say that functions are first-class citizens? - functions are variables just like any other data type

Day 9:
* Can you use variables with Dot Notation? - You CAN NOT use variables with Dot Notation
* What is the difference between a method and a function? - a method is a function that is tied to an object
* How do you add properties to an object after you have already created it? - use either dot notation or bracket notation (i.e. car.color = 'red' or car['color'] = 'red')
* Can you have an object inside an object (nest objects)? - absolutely
* How do you declare, insert, & retrieve elements from an array? - using bracket notation or array methods (i.e. push(), pop(), etc.)
* What does it mean when they say that arrays are pass-by-reference? - when you reassign an array you are just copying a reference to the original array so if you change the second array you are also changing the first

Day 10:
* How do you select HTML elements (DOM elements) using JavaScript? - document.querySelector() or document.getElementById()
