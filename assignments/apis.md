# Assignment #11 - AJAX & APIs

Think of an interesting yet simple web app that you might want to make involving APIs.

Some simple APIs are:
* weather: 
  * https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/
  * http://openweathermap.org/api
* music: https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/
* movies:
  * http://www.omdbapi.com/
  * https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api
* tv shows: http://www.tvmaze.com/api

Be sure to make an app that you would use or that you would want to show to a potential employer.

Don't just get data from a server, display it in a meaningful/creative way.

Creativity takes time so take the time to think and plan what you will create before you start coding.

You can start from scratch or take the weather app we made in class and modify it.
