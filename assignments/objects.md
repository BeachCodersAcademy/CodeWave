1. Create a variable called myCat, store an object in it, and assign to it these properties:
* name - should be a string
* age - should be a number
* isAlive - should be a boolean
2. Add at least two more properties of your choosing (one of them being another object)
3. practice console.log()ing each property individually
4. Try to change the value of an existing property after the object has been declared
hint: object.property = "new value!";
5. Try to add a new property to the object after it has been declared
