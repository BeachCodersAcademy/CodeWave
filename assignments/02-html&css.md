Create a "fan" web page about something you are passionate about, be it a tv show, a hobby, or an exotic location

1. Give the whole page a background-color
hint: think about what tag contains all the visual content of the page

2. Make sure to change the color of the page's text
there are multiple ways to apply color. try out hex codes, rgb values, and color names

3. Include at least one image. be sure to appropriately resize it using the height andwidth property

4. Make sure to include at least 15 separate HTML tags

5. Make sure to nest some tags inside others where appropriate
e.g. <p class='outer-paragraph><p class='inner-paragraph'></p></p>

6. Include some informational links to other resources about this passion

7. Include at least one local link to a made up "supplementary page" (this can be as simple as an .html file with some gibberish text on it)

8. Make sure to include a couple of comments along the way

9. Check out some of these fancier CSS properties:
box-shadow
border
border-radius
