# Box Model & Positioning

1. Take your portfolio project and make an external style sheet for it. Hint: use a `<link>` tag.
+ In your index.html file in your portfolio project, take advantage of the various box model CSS properties. these include:
  * margin
  * padding
  * border
  * height/width
+ Try using the 'margin: 0 auto' centering trick on some of your block elements
Note: `<p>` tags and `<div>` tags are the major block elements we've talked about so far.
+ Play around with fixed and absolute positioning. Make something similar to this: http://learnlayout.com/position-example.html
+ Apply your external style sheet to multiple pages. You should start designing a unified theme for all your pages to follow (this is a process that may take a few days).
