# Box Model & Positioning

1. Take your portfolio project and make an external style sheet for it. Hint: use a `<link>` tag.
+ In your index.html file in your portfolio project, take advantage of the various box model CSS properties. these include:
  * margin
  * padding
  * border
  * height/width
+ Try using the 'margin: 0 auto' centering trick on some of your block elements
Note: `<p>` tags and `<div>` tags are the major block elements we've talked about so far.
+ Play around with fixed and absolute positioning. Make something similar to this: http://learnlayout.com/position-example.html
+ Create a navbar that is fixed to the top of the screen.
+ Make sure the buttons in the navbar line up next to one another, rather than stacking.
Hint: try the `display:inline-block` property
+ Make each of these buttons clickable links that take you to other pages/sites.
+ Try sliding a made up "brand" image into the navbar.
