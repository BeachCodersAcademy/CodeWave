### Rock Paper Scissors

Create a rock paper scissors game with the following guidelines:

1. Prompt the use to enter "r" for rock, "p" for paper, or "s" for scissors.
* Use a random number generator to choose a throw for the computer.
* Display to the user who won the toss (be sure to include what the computer threw).
* Keep track of the points. After every toss, display who has how many points.

When you are finished with this exercise, sketch out an idea of what you want your main website to look like. Think of an idea and give it a nice "feel". Think about what you are interested in, be it sports, fashion, or programming.
