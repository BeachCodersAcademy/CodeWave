# HTML

If you want a crash course on HTML & CSS on your own time we highly HIGHLY recommend [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web), and [SoloLearn](http://www.sololearn.com/Course/HTML/)

Going through a course above will greatly help you finish the assignment and have a better grasp of the material.

1. Create a new project (folder) inside your 'GitHub' folder and call it 'your name' (i.e. I would call it 'christoph')
2. Inside this folder create a me.html file, a folder for images, and a folder for other html pages.
3. In your me.html file create a super simple webpage containing information about yourself. Your me.html page must have: 
    * an image
    * a list
    * a horizontal line
    * bold text
    * a link to a website
4. In your 'pages' folder create a file called 'my-pet.html'.
    In this 'pet' file write about your pet or a pet you wish you had. Make sure to add an image of the animal but have the image saved in your images folder.
  Have a 'back' button that takes you from your 'pet' file to your 'me.html' file.
  Add a link to your 'pet' file in your 'me.html' file.
5. Go here: http://568397435.r.lightningbase-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/html5-cheat-sheet.png
    and use three other tags of your choice. Feel free to look up what these tags do.
6. Play around with CSS so you have a head start for tomorrow!
