1. In your index.html file in your portfolio project, use <div> tags to give organization to your page. Feel free to reference my files for some inspiration.
2. Make sure to take advantage of the various box model CSS properties. these include:
margin
padding
border
height/width
3. Try using the margin:0 auto centering trick on some of your block elements
Note: <p> tags and <div> tags are the major block elements we've talked about so far.
4. Play around with fixed and absolute positioning. Make something similar to this: http://learnlayout.com/position-example.html
5. Add some custom fonts! Check out the google fonts page for some lovely web safe fonts.
6. Apply your external style sheet to multiple pages. You should start designing a unified theme for all your pages to follow (this is a process that may take a few days)
7. Applying box-shadow and border-radius to some of your block elements
