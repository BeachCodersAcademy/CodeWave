# Forms & Transitions

Create a "Contact Me" form or any form you like.

Make sure to use at least 4 of the following input tag types:

* text
* password
* date
* radio
* checkbox
* email
* color
* textarea
* number
* range
* tel
* time
* url

Note: textarea is its own tag. it is not a type of input

Include an input tag with a type="submit" attribute at the very end, otherwise you won't be able to send this form.

Hook your form up to formspree.io. Sadly, the form won't actually work until we get these sites hosted.

Use CSS Transitions to spruce up your form or any other web page you have made thus far.
