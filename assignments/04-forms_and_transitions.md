# Forms & Transitions

Take your fan web page and modify it in these ways:
1. Put the CSS in a separate file (always separate HTML and CSS)
2. Use the hover pseudo selector to change something on your page
3. Use CSS transitions in creative ways to enhance your user's experience
4. Play around with HTML & CSS and get comfortable with it
