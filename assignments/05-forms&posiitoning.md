Let's use what we've learned to create functional forms and arbitrarily positioned elements.

Create a "Contact Me" form
You can start a new project or add it to an existing one.
Make sure to use the following input tag types:
* text
* password
* date
* radio
* checkbox
Try out some other input types, such as:
email
* color
* date
* textarea
note: textarea is its own tag. it is not a type of input

Include an input tag with a type="submit" attribute at the very end, otherwise you won't be able to send this form

Hook your form up to formspree.io. sadly, the form won't actually work until we get these sites hosted.

Creating a navbar
* Create a navbar that is fixed to the top of the screen
* Make sure the buttons in the navbar line up next to one another, rather than stacking.
hint: try the display:inline-block property
* Make each of these buttons clickable links that take you to other pages on your site
* Try sliding a made up "brand" image into the navbar. 
* bonus: try using pseudo-selectors and the transition property to make the individual navbar buttons highlight when the mouse hovers over them.
