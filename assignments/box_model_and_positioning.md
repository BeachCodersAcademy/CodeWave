# Box Model & Positioning

Spice up an existing project!
Take one of your previous projects and add some flavor to it!

1. Link your project to an external style sheet.
* Take advantage of margin, padding, and border properties.
* Try using the 'margin: 0 auto' centering trick on some of your block elements. Note: `<p>` tags and `<div>` tags are the major block elements we've talked about so far.
* Play around with fixed and absolute positioning. Make something similar to this: http://learnlayout.com/position-example.html.
* Create a navbar that is fixed to the top of the screen.
* Make the buttons in the navbar line up next to one another, rather than stacking. Hint: try the `display:inline-block` property
* Make each of these buttons clickable links that take you to other pages/sites.
* Try sliding a made up "brand" image into the navbar.
