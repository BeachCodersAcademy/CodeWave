# Bootstrap

Make sure you have bootstrap imported in an html file (link to it). The correct order is:
  * Bootstrap CSS
  * Custom CSS
  * jQuery
  * Bootstrap JS

Come up with an interesting idea for a website (like to our Farmer's Market concept). It can be about anything as long as it interests you.

Make your website with the following components:
  * a grid system
  * custom Bootstrap classes (i.e. `text-center`, `img-responsive`, & `text-uppercase`)
  * try out some button classes (i.e. `btn-info`)
  * use a few image shapes (i.e. `img-circle` & `img-thumbnail`)
  * make an eye-catching jumbotron (full width or not)
  * navbar - use the `navbar-fixed` class to keep this navbar locked to the top of the viewport
  * at least two other components from the components page (i.e. well & panel)

Bonus: Look up some bootstrap themes & try to use them. Or use the website we used in class, [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/).
