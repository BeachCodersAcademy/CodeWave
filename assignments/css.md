# CSS

Create a "fan" web page about something you are passionate about, be it a tv show, a hobby, or an exotic location. Add a questionnaire or some type of form to the page - be creative!
When starting out it's easiest to get the HTML done first and then style it all with CSS. Writing code isn't supposed to be fast. Take your time and plan out your approach.

1. Give the page a background image.
* Change the font on the page to a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
* Change the color of some text.
* Center some things on the page. Check out some [centering tricks](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.en.html).
* Include some informational links to other resources about this passion but make these links in the form of buttons or images.
* Add a correctly set up form to the page. This could be a simple "Add your email address to our mailing list" or a more complex questionnaire asking the user about something they're passionate about or about your passion.
* Add some of these fancier CSS properties:
  * box-shadow
  * border
  * border-radius
