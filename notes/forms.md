# Forms

Things to take note of:

* **Always** have a 'name' attribute on each form element.
* Use the `autofocus` attribute so focus on a specific element when the page loads.
* Use the `required` attribute so certain form elements are not left empty.
* Use the `placeholder` attribute to display expected input.
